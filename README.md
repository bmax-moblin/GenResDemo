This sample projects demostrates how resource files (strings.xml, dimens.xml, colors.xml) can be generated by a Gradle script. 
The purpose of this script is to assist the developer by generating the annoying markup files from the supplied name/value pairs. 
Note, that the default destination file name and directory can be overriden by a child task.
